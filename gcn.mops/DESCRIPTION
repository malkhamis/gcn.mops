Title: gcn.MOPS: Accelerating cn.MOPS with GPU
Description: cn.MOPS is a model-based algorithm used to quantitatively 
    detect copy-number variations in next-generation, DNA-sequencing 
    data. The algorithm is implemented as an R package and can speed up 
    processing with multi-CPU parallelism. However, the maximum achievable 
    speedup is limited by the overhead of multi-CPU parallelism, which 
    increases with the number of CPU cores used. In this package, an 
    alternative mechanism of process acceleration is implemented which
    utilizes nVidia GPU.
