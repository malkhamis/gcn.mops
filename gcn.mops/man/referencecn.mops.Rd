setting.}
\usage{
referencecn.mops(cases, controls, I = c(0.025, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4,
  8, 16, 32, 64), classes = paste("CN", c(0:8, 16, 32, 64, 128), sep = ""),
  priorImpact = 1, cyc = 20, parallel = 0, norm = 1,
  normType = "poisson", sizeFactor = "mean", normQu = 0.25,
  quSizeFactor = 0.75, upperThreshold = 0.5, lowerThreshold = -0.9,
  minWidth = 4, segAlgorithm = "DNAcopy", minReadCount = 1, verbose = 1,
  returnPosterior = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cases}{Either an instance of "GRanges" or a raw data matrix, where
columns are interpreted as samples and rows as genomic regions. An entry is
the read count of a sample in the genomic region.}

\item{controls}{Either an instance of "GRanges" or a raw data matrix, where
columns are interpreted as samples and rows as genomic regions. An entry is
the read count of a sample in the genomic region.}

\item{I}{Vector positive real values that contain the expected fold change
of the copy number classes.  Length of this vector must be equal to the 
length of the "classes" parameter vector. For human copy number polymorphisms 
we suggest to use the default I = c(0.025,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4,8,16,32,64).}

\item{classes}{Vector of characters of the same length as the parameter
vector "I". One vector element must be named "CN2". The names reflect the 
labels of the copy number classes. 
Default = paste("CN",c(0:8,16,32,64,128),sep="").}

\item{priorImpact}{Positive real value that reflects how strong the prior
assumption affects the result. The higher the value the more samples will
be assumed to have copy number 2. Default = 1.}

\item{cyc}{Positive integer that sets the number of cycles for the algorithm.
Usually after less than 15 cycles convergence is reached. Default = 20.}

\item{parallel}{How many cores are used for the computation. If set to zero
than no parallelization is applied. Default = 0.}

\item{norm}{The normalization strategy to be used. 
If set to 0 the read counts are not normalized and cn.mops does not model 
different coverages. 
If set to 1 the read counts are normalized. 
If set to 2 the read counts are not normalized and cn.mops models different
coverages. (Default=1).}

\item{normType}{Mode of the normalization technique. Possible values are 
"mean","min","median","quant", "poisson" and "mode". 
Read counts will be scaled sample-wise. Default = "poisson".}

\item{sizeFactor}{By this parameter one can decide to how the size factors 
are calculated.
Possible choices are the the mean, median or mode coverage ("mean", "median", "mode") or any quantile 
("quant").}

\item{normQu}{Real value between 0 and 1.
If the "normType" parameter is set to "quant" then this parameter sets the 
quantile that is used for the normalization. Default = 0.25.}

\item{quSizeFactor}{Quantile of the sizeFactor if sizeFactor is set to "quant".
0.75 corresponds to "upper quartile normalization". Real value between 0 and 1. Default = 0.75.}

\item{upperThreshold}{Positive real value that sets the cut-off for copy
number gains. All CNV calling values above this value will be called as 
"gain". The value should be set close to the log2 of the expected foldchange
for copy number 3 or 4. Default = 0.5.}

\item{lowerThreshold}{Negative real value that sets the cut-off for copy
number losses. All CNV calling values below this value will be called as 
"loss". The value should be set close to the log2 of the expected foldchange
for copy number 1 or 0. Default = -0.9.}

\item{minWidth}{Positive integer that is exactly the parameter "min.width"
of the "segment" function of "DNAcopy". minWidth is the minimum number 
of segments a CNV should span. Default = 3.}

\item{segAlgorithm}{Which segmentation algorithm should be used. If set to
"DNAcopy" circular binary segmentation is performed. Any other value will
initiate the use of our fast segmentation algorithm. Default = "DNAcopy".}

\item{minReadCount}{If all samples are below this value the algorithm will
return the prior knowledge. This prevents that the algorithm from being 
applied to segments with very low coverage. Default=1.}

\item{verbose}{Flag that decides whether referencecn.mops gives status
if (verbose>0) messages. Default=1.}

\item{returnPosterior}{Flag that decides whether the posterior probabilities
should be returned. The posterior probabilities have a dimension of samples
times copy number states times genomic regions and therefore consume a lot
of memory. Default=FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters will be passed to the "DNAcopy"
or the standard segmentation algorithm.}

An instance of "CNVDetectionResult".
